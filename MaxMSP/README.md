## About these examples

These examples should give you an idea how to use the Tickle instrument with Max.

Make sure to add this folder to the Max search path because otherwise Max can't find the abstractions and soundfiles.

You might want to look at the Pd examples for now.

The subfolder `chair` contains useful helpers and abstractions of general use with the Tickle. They are provided with a testcase/helpfile.

Want to help translating them to Max or make even better ones? Get in touch via the issue tracker on gitlab/github or by email `max@chair.audio`
