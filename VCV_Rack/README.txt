Welcome to the VCV Rack examples for the Tickle instrument.

VCV Rack is a virtual Eurorack modular synthesizer. It is free open source software by Andrew Belt. Many modules already come included with it (the "fundamental" package) and many more are available for free or paid from contributing developers.

About these examples:

At some point, we will have an official Tickle module in VCV Rack, but not yet.
For now you can bridge the input of the Hardware via a Pd-patch whcih you will find in the Pd folder of these examples.

Use Jack (Linux), Soundflower (Mac) or LoopBe, Rewire (Win) to route the 6 audio channels into VCV Rack.

They are: Excitation, envelope, gate, x, y, DC-offset.
